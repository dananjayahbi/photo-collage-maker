# Photo-Collage Making Web Tool Development Document

## Introduction
This document outlines the development plan for a professional-level photo-collage making web tool leveraging Agentic AI technology. The tool allows users to create, adjust, and shuffle photo collages with a modern UI built using NextJS and Material-UI (MUI). No databases will be used, and the application will utilize HTML5 Canvas for rendering. The Agentic AI will assist in generating and managing collage layouts autonomously to enhance user experience.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Image Upload
- **Description**: Users can upload multiple images from their local device to begin creating a collage.
- **Details**: 
  - Supports common image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
  - Optional support for entering image URLs.

### 2. Image Selection and Collage Creation
- **Description**: Users select images to include in the collage, triggering the creation process.
- **Details**: 
  - Display thumbnails of uploaded images for selection.
  - Users specify the collage size (e.g., full image size or custom dimensions).

### 3. Initial Grid Generation
- **Description**: Upon selecting images and choosing full image size, the app generates a collage grid system tailored to the selected images.
- **Details**: 
  - The Agentic AI analyzes image dimensions and aspect ratios.
  - Suggests a grid layout from predefined templates to optimize image placement.

### 4. Grid Adjustment
- **Description**: Users can manually adjust the collage grid to suit their preferences.
- **Details**: 
  - Change the number of rows and columns.
  - Resize, merge, or split grid cells.
  - Drag grid lines to customize layout.

### 5. Shuffle Functionality
- **Description**: Users can shuffle the grid, and the system adjusts the image arrangement accordingly.
- **Details**: 
  - Rearranges images within the current grid layout.
  - Optionally suggests a new layout based on shuffled positions.
  - Maintains visual coherence post-shuffle.

### 6. Image Manipulation
- **Description**: Users can edit individual images within the collage.
- **Details**: 
  - Crop, rotate, or zoom images.
  - Adjust image fit within cells (e.g., fill, fit, center).

### 7. Preview and Export
- **Description**: Users can preview and export their finalized collage.
- **Details**: 
  - Real-time preview using HTML5 Canvas.
  - Export as a high-quality image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

### 8. User Interface
- **Description**: A modern, intuitive UI enhances usability.
- **Details**: 
  - Built with MUI components.
  - Drag-and-drop support for image placement.
  - Professional color palette (e.g., neutral tones with accent colors).

## Nonfunctional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- **Description**: The tool must handle image processing efficiently.
- **Details**: 
  - Optimize rendering with Canvas for quick response times.
  - Handle large images without significant lag.

### 2. Usability
- **Description**: The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive.
- **Details**: 
  - Clear labels and tooltips.
  - Accessible design with keyboard navigation.

### 3. Security
- **Description**: User data must be handled securely without persistent storage.
- **Details**: 
  - Images processed in-memory, not saved server-side.
  - Client-side validation for uploads.

### 4. Compatibility
- **Description**: The tool should function across various platforms.
- **Details**: 
  - Compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

### 5. Aesthetics
- **Description**: The UI should reflect a professional standard.
- **Details**: 
  - Use MUI theming for consistency.
  - Color palette: Neutral grays (#F5F5F5), blues (#1976D2), and subtle accents.

## Instructions for Agentic AIs

The Agentic AI enhances the collage-making process by autonomously assisting with grid layout and arrangement. Its instructions are:

- **Image Analysis**: 
  - Analyze uploaded images for dimensions, aspect ratios, and optionally dominant colors.
  - Use this data to inform grid suggestions.

- **Initial Grid Generation**: 
  - Select a grid template from a predefined set (e.g., uniform, mixed-size cells) based on image count and properties.
  - Aim to minimize distortion and empty space.

- **Shuffle Assistance**: 
  - When the user shuffles the grid, rearrange images to maintain visual balance.
  - Optionally propose a new grid layout if the current one becomes suboptimal post-shuffle.

- **User Overrides**: 
  - Allow users to override AI suggestions via manual adjustments.
  - Provide subtle hints (e.g., highlights) for AI-recommended placements.

- **Implementation**: 
  - Use simple heuristics (e.g., aspect ratio matching) or lightweight client-side algorithms.
  - Avoid complex ML models to keep the tool lightweight.

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Quality
- Use TypeScript with NextJS for type safety.
- Write modular, reusable components.
- Maintain consistent code formatting (e.g., Prettier).

### 2. UI/UX Design
- Adhere to Material Design principles via MUI.
- Implement drag-and-drop with visual feedback.
- Ensure accessibility (e.g., ARIA labels).

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Leverage NextJS Image component for optimized loading.
- Use Canvas efficiently for rendering.
- Minimize re-renders with React.memo or useMemo.

### 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for AI logic and UI components.
- Test responsiveness across devices.
- Validate edge cases (e.g., oversized images).

### 5. Security
- Validate image uploads client-side (size, type).
- Use HTTPS for deployment.
- Follow OWASP web security guidelines.

- **Components**: 
  - Image uploader
  - Grid manager (AI-driven)
  - Canvas renderer
  - UI controls (MUI-based)
- **State Management**: Use React Context API for simplicity.

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: NextJS (React-based)
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas
- **Optional Libraries**: 
  - `react-konva` for Canvas integration
